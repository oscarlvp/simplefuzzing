A simple replication of the experiments described in the 
[*Lexical Fuzzing*](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/02_Lexical_Fuzzing.html) chapter of 
[*The Fuzzing Book*](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/) but using Java as the implementation language and [JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org/) to monitor the code coverage.
